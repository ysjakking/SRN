        var observations="Seq2Seq-Greedy is only able to generate one meaningful caption. Although Seq2Seq-Random generates highly diverse captions, most of them are less reasonable and not grammatical. Seq2Seq-Beam10 produces meaningful captions with low diversity. The proposed SRN is able to balance the tradeoff between improving diversity and performing reasonable inferring.</br> However, there are also failing examples for this difficult task in open-domain scenario. We find the provided ground-truth set is still limited for us to effectively train SRN, i.e., only 2.28 ground-truth captions are provided for each video. In future works, we will improve SRN to overcome this limitation. "
