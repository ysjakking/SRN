# SRN
Project page for 'Structured Stochastic Recurrent Network (SRN) for Linguistic Video Prediction (LVP)' in ACMMM19.

Intelligent machines are expected to have the capability of predicting impending occurrences. Inspired by video frame prediction and video captioning, we introduce a new task of Linguistic Video Prediction (LVP), which aims to predict the forthcoming events based on past video content and generatecorresponding linguistic descriptions. Different from traditional video captioning that describes one specifically happened event, LVP is an open task involving one-to-many mappings between past and future. It explores different visual clues and associates them with potential events to generate corresponding descriptions.
